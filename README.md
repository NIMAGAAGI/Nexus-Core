# NEXUS Core

**Private, local-first cognitive AI core for supervised autonomy, memory, and voice-driven intelligent systems.**

---

## Overview

NEXUS Core is a **local-first cognitive intelligence framework** designed to build AI systems that can reason, remember, and act — **without surrendering user data, control, or trust**.

This project focuses on **infrastructure**, not UI demos or chatbot experiences.

NEXUS Core is intended for developers, researchers, and builders who want to explore **private, supervised, autonomous intelligence** as a system — not a product feature.

---

## Design Principles

- **Local-first by default**  
  Runs fully offline. Cloud models are optional, never required.

- **Supervised autonomy**  
  The system may act, but only within explicit rules, permissions, and confidence thresholds.

- **Memory with discipline**  
  Structured memory layers with clear rules for when to remember, forget, or decay.

- **Explainability over magic**  
  Every action must be traceable, reversible, and auditable.

- **Voice-first interaction**  
  Built for natural human interaction, not text-first prompts.

## What This Project Provides

- Cognitive reasoning loop (local or hybrid LLM)
- Structured memory system (short-term, long-term, habits)
- Supervised autonomy engine
- Safety & permission enforcement
- Action routing framework (system, browser, devices)
- Voice pipeline abstractions (wake-word, STT, TTS)

---

## What This Project Does NOT Include

- UI / frontend applications
- Voice likeness or branded personalities
- Commercial integrations
- Hosted services or telemetry

These are intentionally excluded.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Private personal AI assistants
- Local-first enterprise AI systems
- Cognitive systems research
- Autonomy and safety experimentation
- Offline or air-gapped environments

---

## Project Status

⚠️ **Early but real**

The architecture is stable.  
APIs and internal modules may evolve.

This project prioritizes **correctness and safety over speed**.

## Philosophy

> Intelligence without boundaries is dangerous.  
> Autonomy without supervision is irresponsible.  
> Trust must be engineered — not promised.
